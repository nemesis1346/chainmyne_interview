# ChainMyne Challenge 1

What I did here was to create a simple react app with a main Page that has a table that feetches the data of CoinGecko. I tool the liberty of adding 100 coins with its relevant information AND ALSO I added a cron job that will fetch new data each 10 seconds to get updates of the coins in real time.

The app can run both in a mobile(browser url) and in desktop so you can check that render smoothly in both

The following url is where the app is published.

I used simple github pages for simplification since this React app is directly fething data and not relying on a server
